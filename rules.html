    <h1>Memory Game Rules</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Memory Game! Here are the rules:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The game consists of a set of cards with matching pairs.</li>
        <li>Shuffle the cards and place them face down on the playing area.</li>
        <li>Players take turns flipping two cards at a time to find matching pairs.</li>
        <li>If a player finds a matching pair, they get a point and continue their turn.</li>
        <li>If the cards do not match, they are flipped back, and it's the next player's turn.</li>
    </ol>
